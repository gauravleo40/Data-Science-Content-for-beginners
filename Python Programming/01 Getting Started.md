# Where to write codes - Accessing an Online Platform/Application/Tool/IDE

---

## 📌 Overview

One of the biggest roadblocks beginners face when learning Python is getting stuck in the **technical steps of downloading, installing, and setting up a coding environment**. For many, this becomes a barrier rather than a motivation. And honestly, it doesn’t have to be that way.

When I first started out, my biggest question was simple:  
**"Where do I even write Python code?"**

I read countless articles, watched a bunch of tutorials, and by the time I finally reached the right platform to try coding, the initial excitement had already faded. That delay — just getting started — was enough to slow me down.

That’s why this page begins with something different.  
Before we dive into learning Python, I want to **show you how quick and easy it is to access a coding platform** — no downloads, no complicated setup. Just open, type, and run.

As a beginner, it’s completely okay if you don’t know whether to call it a *platform*, a *tool*, or an *application*. What matters most is this: **you take your first step**.  

This guide will help you get a **first-hand experience** with a few beginner-friendly online platforms that let you write and run Python code — right from your browser.

👉 Once you get comfortable here and you're still curious to learn more (which I’m sure you will be!), we’ll move on to setting up Python on your own system — and I’ll guide you every step of the way.

So take a deep breath, leave the fear behind, and let’s begin!

## 🌐 Google Colab – The Preferred Choice

**Google Colab** is an online notebook where you can write and run Python code directly from your browser. It’s free to use and requires **no installations or setup**.

### ✅ What You Need:
- A **Google account** (like Gmail)
- A browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### 🚀 How to Get Started:
1. Visit 👉 [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. If prompted, sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on the **"New Notebook"** button (usually found at the bottom-right corner or top-left corner).
4. A new page will open with a code cell ready to go!

### ✨ Why Colab is a Great Starting Point:
- No setup hassles — you can start coding instantly.
- Runs on the cloud, so no need for a powerful computer.
- You can save your notebooks directly to your Google Drive.

## 🌐 Jupyter.org – Another Beginner-Friendly Option

Another excellent way to explore Python online is through **Jupyter.org**.

### 🚀 How to Try It:
1. Visit 👉 [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
2. Click on the **“Try JupyterLab”** option (you may also try "Classic Notebook").
3. Wait a few seconds — a free, temporary notebook will open.
4. Click on **File > New > Notebook**, and select Python (usually Python 3).

That’s it! You’re now in a live Python notebook ready to write your first code.

## 👨‍💻 Let’s Write and Run Your First Python Code!

Copy the following code and paste it in **either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook**:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to your first Python session.")
```

### ▶️ How to Run the Code

Here’s how you can execute your first Python code on both platforms:

**🔹 On Google Colab**
- Click inside the code cell
- Press `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard

**🔹 On Jupyter Notebook (via jupyter.org)**
- Click the code cell to select it
- Press `Shift + Enter` to run it

💡 After you press `Shift + Enter`, the cell will execute, and you’ll see the output just below the code. Try entering your name when prompted!

### 🧭 What’s Next?

Now that you've taken your **first step into Python programming** by writing and running code online, here’s what you can do next:

- 🔁 **Repeat the process** a few times — try changing the `print()` message or add another line of code.
- 🤹 **Experiment freely** — don't worry about breaking things. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- ✅ **Build a small routine** — spend 10–15 minutes a day exploring and trying out Python basics.
- 💬 **Ask questions and seek clarity** — if something doesn’t make sense, note it down. We'll cover it in the upcoming lessons.

And once you're feeling a bit more confident with writing code online, you’ll be ready for the next big step:  
👉 **Setting up Python on your own computer (offline)** — and yes, we’ll guide you through it, step by step.
