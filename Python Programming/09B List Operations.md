# üõ†Ô∏è Mastering List Operations: Python's Built-in Tools

### Unlocking the full potential of Python's flexible Lists

# 1. Understanding List operations: Beyond basic access

By now you've got a solid handle on what Python lists are, how to create them (remember those square brackets `[]`), and their mutable property: .i.e., being changeable! You can even grab specific items using indexing and slicing, and directly update a value if you make a mistake. That's the first step!

But what if you need to do more than just tweak one item? What if you want to add new information, completely clean out old data, or arrange everything in a specific order, like alphabetically or from smallest to largest? These are all common tasks when you work with real data.

The good news is, you don't have to invent how to do any of this from scratch! Python gives us a powerful set of readymade tools to manage our lists. This file is all about understanding and using those tools.

## 1.1 What will you learn here?

In this file, we're going to dive deep into the different kinds of actions and operations you can perform with lists. We'll cover:

* **List Methods:** These are special "actions" that lists know how to do on themselves.
* **Built-in Functions:** Python provides general-purpose functions that work wonderfully with lists.
* **Keywords & Operators:** Special Python words and symbols that let you perform operations like checking for an item's existence or combining lists.

> As you learn about these list operations, always keep the 'why' in mind. Your ultimate goal isn't just to memorize methods, but to solve real-world problems. Think of these list operations as essential tools in your programming toolkit. When faced with a business challenge say, managing customer orders, updating player scores, or tracking inventory the problem won't explicitly tell you to `append()` something or `sort()` a list. Instead, you'll need to look at the information you have (often stored in a list!) and then **figure out and choose the right operation** to achieve your desired outcome. That's why practice is so important: try to imagine different scenarios and then ask yourself, "Which list operation can help me here?" This way, you'll learn to apply these tools effectively, becoming a true problem solver.

## 1.2 Introducing "Methods": Actions for your data

Let's start with a really important concept: **methods**.

Imagine your Python list is like a smart device, say, your smartphone. It doesn't just hold your apps; it also has specific "buttons" or "features" built right into it. When you want to take a photo, you tap the camera app. When you want to make a call, you tap the phone app.

In Python, a **method** is exactly like one of those specific built-in features for your data! It's a special action or command that a particular type of data like a List knows how to perform on itself. When you want your list to do something specific (like add a new item or remove an old one), you "press its button" by calling one of its methods.

> Why do lists have these? Because they're designed for managing collections of items, and these methods provide efficient, pre-written ways to handle common tasks like adding, removing, sorting, and more. You don't have to write the code for *how* to sort a list; you just tell the list to `sort()` itself!

And just like your phone has different features than your washing machine, different types of data type in Python, whether they are numbers (integer, float), text (strings), or even Data Structures (which you'll explore later), have their *own* unique sets of methods tailored to what they do best. It's all about having the right tool for the job!

## 1.3 How to use a List method

Using a List method is pretty straightforward. You simply write the name of your list variable, then type a **dot (`.`)**, and then the **method's name** followed by **parentheses `()`**.

It looks like this: `list_name.method_name(arguments)`

Those parentheses are important! Sometimes they'll be empty if the method doesn't need any extra details to do its job. Other times, you'll put specific information inside them, called as **arguments**, which tell the method exactly what to do. For example, if you're using a method to *insert* an item, you need to tell it *which* item to insert and *where* (at what index) to put it!

One crucial thing to always pay attention to: some methods will actually change your original list directly (we call this modifying it "**in-place**"). Others will leave your original list just as it is, and instead give you a brand new list with the changes. We'll make sure to point out this important distinction for each method we discuss!

# 2\. Quick Reference: Essential List Methods

## 2.1 Exploring List methods yourself (`dir()` and `help()`)

Python provides built-in tools to discover methods. You can use `dir(list)` to see all methods and attributes available for list objects, and `help(list.method_name)` for detailed documentation on a specific method.

## 2.2 Table: Essential List Methods at a Glance

| Category      | Method Name                                | Description in Simple Words                                   | Simple Example(s) & Output                                   |

| **Adding** | `append()`                                 | Adds a single item to the end of the list.                    | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2]\nmy_list.append(3)\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3]`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nmy_list.append([4, 5])\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]` |
|               | `insert()`                                 | Adds an item at a specific position (index).                  | `python\nmy_list = ['a', 'c']\nmy_list.insert(1, 'b')\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nmy_list.insert(100, 'z') # Inserts at end if index too large\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'z']` |
|               | `extend()`                                 | Adds all items from another list (or iterable) to the end.    | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2]\nanother_list = [3, 4]\nmy_list.extend(another_list)\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]` |
| **Removing** | `remove()`                                 | Removes the *first* occurrence of a specified item by its *value*. | `python\nmy_list = ['x', 'y', 'x']\nmy_list.remove('x')\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: ['y', 'x']` |
|               | `pop()`                                    | Removes and returns an item at a given index (defaults to last). | `python\nmy_list = [10, 20, 30]\nlast_item = my_list.pop()\nprint(last_item, my_list)\n# Output: 30 [10, 20]`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nfirst_item = my_list.pop(0)\nprint(first_item, my_list)\n# Output: 10 [20]` |
|               | `clear()`                                  | Removes all items from the list.                              | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_list.clear()\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: []` |
|               | `del` (keyword)                            | Deletes items by index or slice (not a method, but a core deletion tool). | `python\nmy_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\ndel my_list[0]\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: ['b', 'c']`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndel my_list[1:4]\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [1, 5]` |
| **Inspecting**| `in` (keyword)                             | Checks if an item exists in the list (returns `True`/`False`). | `python\nmy_list = ['apple', 'banana']\nprint('apple' in my_list)\n# Output: True` |
|               | `index()`                                  | Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified item. | `python\nmy_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b']\nprint(my_list.index('b'))\n# Output: 1`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nprint(my_list.index('b', 2))\n# Output: 3` |
|               | `count()`                                  | Returns the number of times a specified item appears in the list. | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nprint(my_list.count(2))\n# Output: 3` |
| **Ordering** | `sort()`                                   | Sorts the items of the list in-place.                         | `python\nmy_list = [3, 1, 2]\nmy_list.sort()\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3]`\<br\>\<br\>`python\nmy_list.sort(reverse=True)\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [3, 2, 1]` |
|               | `sorted()` (built-in)                      | Returns a *new* sorted list from an iterable (doesn't modify original). | `python\nmy_list = [3, 1, 2]\nnew_list = sorted(my_list)\nprint(my_list, new_list)\n# Output: [3, 1, 2] [1, 2, 3]` |
|               | `reverse()`                                | Reverses the order of items in the list in-place.             | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_list.reverse()\nprint(my_list)\n# Output: [3, 2, 1]` |
|               | Slicing with `[::-1]` (trick)              | Returns a *new* reversed list using slicing (doesn't modify original). | `python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nnew_list = my_list[::-1]\nprint(my_list, new_list)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3] [3, 2, 1]` |

# 3\. Detailed Exploration: Adding Items to Lists

## 3.1 The `append()` Method: Adding to the end

Lists are dynamic, meaning they can grow. The `append()` method is the simplest way to add new items. It adds a single item to the very end of your list. The list is modified *in-place*.

### Basic usage of `append()`

```python
# A list of initial tasks
tasks = ["Read chapter", "Complete exercise"]
print("Original tasks:", tasks)

# Add a new task
tasks.append("Review notes")
print("Tasks after append:", tasks)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original tasks: ['Read chapter', 'Complete exercise']
Tasks after append: ['Read chapter', 'Complete exercise', 'Review notes']
```

### Appending a list as a single item

It's important to note that `append()` always adds its argument as a *single item*. If you append another list, that entire list becomes one item *inside* your original list.

```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "milk"]
print("Initial shopping list:", shopping_list)

# Append a list of vegetables as one item
shopping_list.append(["carrots", "onions"])
print("Shopping list after appending another list:", shopping_list)
print("Type of the last item:", type(shopping_list[-1]))
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Initial shopping list: ['apples', 'milk']
Shopping list after appending another list: ['apples', 'milk', ['carrots', 'onions']]
Type of the last item: <class 'list'>
```

Notice how `["carrots", "onions"]` became a single item at the end, making the outer list now contain a list as one of its elements.

## 3.2 The `insert()` Method: Adding at a specific position

While `append()` adds to the end, `insert()` gives you control over *where* in the list the new item goes. You specify the `index` where you want to insert the item, and the item that was originally at that index (and all subsequent items) will shift to the right to make space. The list is modified *in-place*.

The syntax is `your_list.insert(index, item)`.

### Basic usage of `insert()`

```python
# A list of ordered steps
workflow = ["Start", "Process", "End"]
print("Original workflow:", workflow)

# Insert a "Validation" step at index 1
workflow.insert(1, "Validation")
print("Workflow after inserting at index 1:", workflow)

# Insert a "Cleanup" step at index 3
workflow.insert(3, "Cleanup")
print("Workflow after inserting at index 3:", workflow)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original workflow: ['Start', 'Process', 'End']
Workflow after inserting at index 1: ['Start', 'Validation', 'Process', 'End']
Workflow after inserting at index 3: ['Start', 'Validation', 'Process', 'Cleanup', 'End']
```

### Inserting beyond the end of the list

If the `index` you provide to `insert()` is greater than or equal to the current length of the list, the item will simply be added to the end, behaving like `append()`.

```python
short_list = [10, 20]
print("Initial short list:", short_list)

# Try to insert at index 5 (list has only 2 items, max index 1)
short_list.insert(5, 30)
print("After inserting at out-of-bounds index:", short_list)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Initial short list: [10, 20]
After inserting at out-of-bounds index: [10, 20, 30]
```

## 3.3 The `extend()` Method: Adding multiple items from another iterable

The `extend()` method is used to add all the individual items from another "iterable" (like another list, a tuple, or a string) to the end of your current list. Unlike `append()`, which adds a single item, `extend()` "extends" your list by incorporating each element from the given iterable. The list is modified *in-place*.

The syntax is `your_list.extend(iterable)`.

### Extending with another list

```python
team_a = ["Alice", "Bob"]
team_b = ["Charlie", "David"]
print("Initial Team A:", team_a)
print("Initial Team B:", team_b)

# Combine Team B into Team A
team_a.extend(team_b)
print("Team A after extending with Team B:", team_a)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Initial Team A: ['Alice', 'Bob']
Initial Team B: ['Charlie', 'David']
Team A after extending with Team B: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
```

### `extend()` vs. `append()`: A common confusion point

This is a very common area of confusion for beginners. Remember:

  * **`append()`** adds the *entire object* you give it as a *single item* to the end.
  * **`extend()`** adds *each individual element* from the iterable you give it to the end.

<!-- end list -->

```python
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [1, 2]
items_to_add = [3, 4]

print("--- append() example ---")
list1.append(items_to_add) # Adds [3, 4] as one item
print(f"List after append: {list1}")
# Output: List after append: [1, 2, [3, 4]]

print("\n--- extend() example ---")
list2.extend(items_to_add) # Adds 3, then 4 individually
print(f"List after extend: {list2}")
# Output: List after extend: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
--- append() example ---
List after append: [1, 2, [3, 4]]

--- extend() example ---
List after extend: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

# 4\. Detailed Exploration: Removing Items from Lists

Just as you can add items to lists, you can also remove them. Python provides several methods and one keyword for this purpose, each suited for slightly different situations: removing by value, removing by index, or clearing the entire list.

## 4.1 The `remove()` Method: Removing by value

The `remove()` method helps you delete the *first occurrence* of a specific item by its *value*. If the item appears multiple times in the list, only the first one encountered will be removed. This method modifies the list *in-place*.

The syntax is `your_list.remove(value)`.

### Basic usage of `remove()`

```python
# A list of colors with a duplicate
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
print("Original colors:", colors)

# Remove the first occurrence of "green"
colors.remove("green")
print("Colors after removing 'green':", colors)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original colors: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']
Colors after removing 'green': ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']
```

### Handling non-existent values (`ValueError`)

If you try to remove a value that is not present in the list, Python will raise a `ValueError`. It's a good practice to check if an item exists using the `in` keyword (which we'll cover later) before attempting to remove it, especially in more complex programs.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print("Current list:", my_list)

try:
    my_list.remove('grape') # 'grape' is not in the list
    print("List after attempt to remove 'grape':", my_list)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Current list: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
Error: list.remove(x): x not in list
```

## 4.2 The `pop()` Method: Removing by index (and getting the item)

The `pop()` method is unique because it not only removes an item from the list but also **returns** the removed item. This is incredibly useful when you need to use the item you're taking out of the list. It modifies the list *in-place*.

### Removing the last item (`pop()` without arguments)

If you call `pop()` without any arguments, it removes and returns the last item in the list.

```python
# A list representing tasks on a stack (Last-In, First-Out)
task_stack = ["Task A", "Task B", "Task C"]
print("Original task stack:", task_stack)

# Complete the last task
completed_task = task_stack.pop()
print(f"Completed task: '{completed_task}'")
print("Task stack remaining:", task_stack)

# Complete another task
another_completed = task_stack.pop()
print(f"Completed task: '{another_completed}'")
print("Task stack remaining:", task_stack)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original task stack: ['Task A', 'Task B', 'Task C']
Completed task: 'Task C'
Task stack remaining: ['Task A', 'Task B']
Completed task: 'Task B'
Task stack remaining: ['Task A']
```

### Removing an item at a specific index (`pop(index)`)

You can also provide an `index` to `pop()`. It will then remove and return the item at that specific position.

```python
# A list of daily agenda items
agenda = ["Morning Meeting", "Client Call", "Team Lunch", "Project Review"]
print("Original agenda:", agenda)

# Remove the item at index 1 (Client Call)
removed_item = agenda.pop(1)
print(f"Removed from agenda: '{removed_item}'")
print("Agenda remaining:", agenda)

# If you try to pop an invalid index, you will get an IndexError.
try:
    agenda.pop(100)
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error trying to pop invalid index: {e}")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original agenda: ['Morning Meeting', 'Client Call', 'Team Lunch', 'Project Review']
Removed from agenda: 'Client Call'
Agenda remaining: ['Morning Meeting', 'Team Lunch', 'Project Review']
Error trying to pop invalid index: pop index out of range
```

## 4.3 The `clear()` Method: Removing all items

The `clear()` method is the quickest way to remove all items from a list, making it empty. It modifies the list *in-place*.

```python
# A list of temporary files
temp_files = ["report.pdf", "image.jpg", "data.csv"]
print("Temporary files:", temp_files)

# Clear all temporary files
temp_files.clear()
print("Temporary files after clearing:", temp_files)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Temporary files: ['report.pdf', 'image.jpg', 'data.csv']
Temporary files after clearing: []
```

## 4.4 The `del` keyword: Removing by index/slice (no return value)

The `del` keyword is a general-purpose Python statement used to delete objects. When used with lists, it allows you to remove items by their index or by a slice, similar to how you would access them. Unlike `pop()`, `del` does *not* return the removed item(s). It modifies the list *in-place*.

### Deleting a single item

You can delete an item at a specific index.

```python
my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("Original numbers:", my_numbers)

# Delete the item at index 2 (which is 30)
del my_numbers[2]
print("Numbers after deleting index 2:", my_numbers)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Numbers after deleting index 2: [10, 20, 40, 50]
```

### Deleting a slice of items

You can also use `del` to remove a range of items from the list using slicing.

```python
all_items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print("Original items:", all_items)

# Delete items from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4
del all_items[1:4] # This removes 'b', 'c', 'd'
print("Items after deleting slice [1:4]:", all_items)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original items: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
Items after deleting slice [1:4]: ['a', 'e', 'f']
```

# 5\. Detailed Exploration: Inspecting and Organizing Lists

Beyond adding and removing, lists provide methods to check for the presence of items, find their positions, count occurrences, and even reorder the entire collection.

## 5.1 Checking for Presence: The `in` keyword

The `in` keyword is not a method, but a very common and readable way to check if a specific item exists within a list. It returns `True` if the item is found, and `False` otherwise. This is useful for avoiding errors (like `ValueError` with `remove()` or `index()`) and for conditional logic.

```python
inventory = ["laptop", "mouse", "keyboard", "monitor"]
print("Current inventory:", inventory)

# Check if 'laptop' is in inventory
if "laptop" in inventory:
    print("Laptop found in inventory.")

# Check if 'printer' is in inventory
if "printer" not in inventory: # You can also use 'not in'
    print("Printer is not in inventory.")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Current inventory: ['laptop', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'monitor']
Laptop found in inventory.
Printer is not in inventory.
```

## 5.2 Finding Items: The `index()` and `count()` Methods

These methods help you get information *about* the items in your list without changing the list itself.

### `index()`: Finding an item's position

The `index()` method returns the **index of the first occurrence** of a specified item. If the item appears multiple times, it only tells you the position of the first one.

### Basic usage of `index()`

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana", "date"]
print("Fruits list:", fruits)

# Find the index of "banana"
banana_index = fruits.index("banana")
print(f"The first 'banana' is at index: {banana_index}")

# Find the index of "cherry"
cherry_index = fruits.index("cherry")
print(f"The 'cherry' is at index: {cherry_index}")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Fruits list: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana', 'date']
The first 'banana' is at index: 1
The 'cherry' is at index: 2
```

### Specifying search range

You can optionally provide `start` and `end` indices to search only within a specific portion of the list: `your_list.index(value, start, end)`.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40, 20]
print("Numbers list:", numbers)

# Find '20' starting from index 2
second_20_index = numbers.index(20, 2)
print(f"The '20' found after index 1 is at index: {second_20_index}") # It finds the 20 at index 3
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Numbers list: [10, 20, 30, 20, 40, 20]
The '20' found after index 1 is at index: 3
```

### Handling non-existent items (`ValueError`)

Similar to `remove()`, if the item is not found in the list (or within the specified range), `index()` will raise a `ValueError`.

```python
my_items = ['pen', 'paper']
try:
    my_items.index('eraser')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Error: 'eraser' is not in list
```

### `count()`: Counting item occurrences

The `count()` method returns the number of times a specified item appears in the list. This is useful for understanding the distribution or frequency of items.

```python
data_points = [1, 5, 2, 5, 8, 5, 3]
print("Data points:", data_points)

# Count how many times '5' appears
count_of_five = data_points.count(5)
print(f"The number '5' appears {count_of_five} times.")

# Count how many times '9' appears (not present)
count_of_nine = data_points.count(9)
print(f"The number '9' appears {count_of_nine} times.")
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Data points: [1, 5, 2, 5, 8, 5, 3]
The number '5' appears 3 times.
The number '9' appears 0 times.
```

## 5.3 Sorting Lists: The `sort()` Method and `sorted()` Function

Sorting is a common operation. Python offers two main ways to sort lists: one that modifies the list directly and one that returns a new sorted list.

### `sort()`: In-place sorting

The `sort()` method sorts the items of the list *in-place*, meaning it changes the order of elements within the original list. By default, it sorts in ascending order (A-Z for strings, smallest to largest for numbers).

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
print("Original numbers:", numbers)

# Sort in ascending order
numbers.sort()
print("Numbers after in-place sort (ascending):", numbers)

# Sort in descending order
alphabets = ['c', 'a', 'b']
print("\nOriginal alphabets:", alphabets)
alphabets.sort(reverse=True) # Use reverse=True for descending
print("Alphabets after in-place sort (descending):", alphabets)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original numbers: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
Numbers after in-place sort (ascending): [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

Original alphabets: ['c', 'a', 'b']
Alphabets after in-place sort (descending): ['c', 'b', 'a']
```

  * **Custom sorting (brief mention for advanced):** For more complex sorting rules (e.g., sorting a list of words by their length), `sort()` and `sorted()` can accept a `key` argument. This is an advanced topic often covered when discussing functions and lambda expressions.

### `sorted()`: Creating a new sorted list

The `sorted()` function is a **built-in Python function** (not a list method). It takes an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) as input and returns a *new list* containing all items from the input in sorted order. Crucially, the original list remains unchanged.

```python
original_data = [5, 1, 9, 3, 7]
print("Original data:", original_data)

# Get a new sorted list
new_sorted_data = sorted(original_data)
print("New sorted data:", new_sorted_data)
print("Original data (unchanged):", original_data) # Original list is not modified

# You can also sort in reverse with sorted()
reverse_sorted_data = sorted(original_data, reverse=True)
print("New reverse-sorted data:", reverse_sorted_data)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original data: [5, 1, 9, 3, 7]
New sorted data: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Original data (unchanged): [5, 1, 9, 3, 7]
New reverse-sorted data: [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]
```

**When to use `sort()` vs. `sorted()`:**

  * Use `sort()` when you want to **modify the original list** and don't need a copy of the unsorted version. It's often more memory-efficient as it doesn't create a new list.
  * Use `sorted()` when you need a **new sorted list** and want to keep the original list intact.

## 5.4 Reversing Lists: The `reverse()` Method and Slicing

Reversing changes the order of items in a list so the last item becomes first, the second-to-last becomes second, and so on.

### `reverse()`: In-place reversal

The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements *in-place*. The original list is modified directly.

```python
order_of_items = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth"]
print("Original order:", order_of_items)

# Reverse the list in-place
order_of_items.reverse()
print("Order after in-place reverse:", order_of_items)
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original order: ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']
Order after in-place reverse: ['fourth', 'third', 'second', 'first']
```

### Slicing with `[::-1]`: Creating a new reversed list

A very common Python trick to create a *new* reversed list (without modifying the original) is to use slicing with a step of `-1`.

```python
original_sequence = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("Original sequence:", original_sequence)

# Create a new reversed list using slicing
reversed_sequence = original_sequence[::-1]
print("New reversed sequence (using slicing):", reversed_sequence)
print("Original sequence (unchanged):", original_sequence) # Original list is not modified
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Output:**

```
Original sequence: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
New reversed sequence (using slicing): [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
Original sequence (unchanged): [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
