# Variables are good but what comes next?

By now, you've already learned how **variables** are an important concept in Python. They let us store values, use them again and again, and make our code easier to work with.

But as you move ahead, youâ€™ll see that while variables are very useful, they are not enough in every situation â€” especially when you have to handle a lot of related information at once.

Before we go into that, letâ€™s take one more real-life example to understand how variables can really help us.

## ðŸ“Œ Example: printing a multiplication table

Letâ€™s say you want to print the multiplication table of a number, like 7. Hereâ€™s one way to write that using a variable:

```python
N = 7

print(N, 'x 1 =', N * 1)
print(N, 'x 2 =', N * 2)
print(N, 'x 3 =', N * 3)
print(N, 'x 4 =', N * 4)
print(N, 'x 5 =', N * 5)
print(N, 'x 6 =', N * 6)
print(N, 'x 7 =', N * 7)
print(N, 'x 8 =', N * 8)
print(N, 'x 9 =', N * 9)
print(N, 'x 10 =', N * 10)
````
*Note that the print() function is used very smartly here by declaring multiple arguments in it:*
- First the variable `N`
- Second the string `x ... = `
- Third a computation on the variable `N`, i.e., `N * ...`

---
Here, it might have take us some time to write all these code lines, but this is just a one-time effort. By using the variable `N` we have saved the time and effort for generating a Table for some other value of `N`, let's say 12

```python
N = 12  # Thatâ€™s it! The rest of the code stays the same.
```

ðŸŸ¡ **Now imagine NOT using a variable at all.** You would have to write the number `7` in all 10 lines. And if you later want to print the table of `12`, youâ€™d have to change every line by hand. Thatâ€™s a lot of extra work whenever the value of `N` needs to be changed. Also itâ€™s easy to make mistakes while making these multiple changes eveytime

> ðŸ’¡ **Note from a more experienced programmer:** A better way to write this code is by using `for` or `while` loops in Python â€” something youâ€™ll learn very soon. But even this small example shows how one variable can make your life easier.
